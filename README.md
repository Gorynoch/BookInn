## üîß Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Use Git to clone the repository onto your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd booking-registration-form
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database:**

   - Create a MySQL database named `booking_registration`.
   - Run the provided SQL schema found in `/database/schema.sql` to create necessary tables.

3. **Configure the Environment:**

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the correct database credentials:

     ```ini
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_NAME=booking_registration
     DB_USER=your_username
     DB_PASS=your_password
     ```

   - Adjust the database connection settings in `config/db.php`:

     ```php
     $dsn = 'mysql:host=' . getenv('DB_HOST') . ';dbname=' . getenv('DB_NAME');
     $username = getenv('DB_USER');
     $password = getenv('DB_PASS');
     ```

4. **Start the Web Server:**

   Place the project files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `/var/www/html` for Apache). Open your browser and navigate to the project URL (e.g., `http://localhost/booking-registration-form`).

## üîç How It Works

The project consists of three primary layers:

1. **Frontend:** User-facing interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client-side validation and enhanced usability.
2. **Backend:** PHP scripts handle form submissions, sanitize user inputs, and interact with the MySQL database.
3. **Database:** MySQL securely stores user data, including hashed passwords using `password_hash`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Registration Process:**

   - Enter valid details (name, email, and password) in the registration form.
   - Submit the form, which triggers both client-side and server-side validations.
   - Upon success, the user's data is stored in the database.

2. **Login Flow:**

   After registering, users can log in using their registered email and password.

3. **Dashboard Access:**

   Successful login redirects users to a personalized dashboard where they can manage bookings and view account-related information.
